# local_network_scan

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Discover open ports on devices in a local network to understand potential network exposure.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Nmap**â€“ For scanning the local network and discovering open ports.
- **VS Code/Notepad** â€“ To organize files and document results.

## ðŸ“‹ Steps Performed
1. Identified the local network range ('192.168.X.0/24') for scanning.  
2. Ran Nmap scans using:
   - '-sS' (SYN scan â€“ stealthy and fast).
   - '-sT' (TCP connect scan â€“ full TCP handshake).
3. Saved scan results as 'nmap_scan_results.txt' (masked IP addresses for privacy).  
4. Found common services running on detected open ports.  
5. Identified **potential security risks** associated with the discovered open ports.  
6. Organized all related files for submission.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included 
- 'nmap_scan_results.txt' â€“ Masked scan results from Nmap. 
- 'scan_commands.txt' â€“ Nmap commands used and their explanations.  
- 'services_info.txt' â€“ Common services found on the scanned ports.  
- 'security_risks.txt' â€“ Security risks identified from the open ports.  

## ðŸ”’ Notes on Privacy
- Device IP addresses have been masked for privacy (eg:'192.168.1.X').  

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
- Nmap is a powerful tool to discover network exposure.  
- Even common ports (eg: 80, 443, 445) can introduce risks if not properly secured.  
- Always mask private IP addresses and sensitive details when sharing results publicly.
