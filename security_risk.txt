#security risks from open ports 

Port 53 (DNS): Could be exploited for DNS cache poisonin  attacks if misconfigured. Limit exposure and use secure DNS settings.

Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted traffic can be intercepted or modified by attackers. Prefer HTTPS to secure communication.

Port 443 (HTTPS): Generally secure, but outdated TLS/SSL versions or weak ciphers could be exploited.
                  So keep certificates and protocols updated.

Port 135 (MSRPC): Often targeted for Windows exploits and remote code execution vulnerabilities (e.g., WannaCry).
                  Should be restricted to trusted networks.

Port 139 (NetBIOS-SSN): Can expose Windows file sharing services to enumeration or brute-force attacks. 
                        Block or limit access to trusted systems only.

Port 445 (Microsoft-DS/SMB): Frequently exploited by ransomware and worms.
